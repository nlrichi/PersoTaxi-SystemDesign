# Sketchs, Wireframes, and Prototypes Description
### Sketch/Prototype 1
This prototype represents the functional requirement *The system should display the personality type of the user under their account details so that drivers, users, and friends of the user can know the user's personality type*. This requirement is reflected in this prototype by having a textbox labelled *Personality Type* which displays the user's personality type under their account details. There is also a back button for the user is done looking at their account details.

### Sketch/Prototype 2
This prototype represents the functional requirement *The user can choose to get matched based on gender, age or personality or even combine.* This requirement is reflected in this prototype by giving the user the option to choose between getting matched by personality type, gender, both, or none. To proceed to the next steps to book a ride, the user will need to click the next button, and there is also a back button if the user decides that they don't want to book a ride at the time.

### Sketch/Prototype 3
This prototype represents the functional requirement *The system must request permission for location tracking so the service can connect users and drivers based on location.* This requirement is reflected in this prototype by providing the user a small desscription for why it is required for the system to track their location, and button for the user to select if they allow the system to do location tracking. The user won't be able to proceed until they allow location tracking.

### Wireframe Welcome Page
The wireframe displays functional requirements 4, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 22, 23. These requirements are reflected in this basic digital wireframe sketch by giving the user a sign in screen; sign up screen and the buttons to move accordingly through the app. Certain functions such as security checks were shown and information was displayed with black filled bars and scroll logos with grey buttons to display a user action to enter/move between displays back and forth. My understanding with wireframes is to keep it very basic as its the inital design and is more used for layout. Hence, why layout on all screens have some similar allocations.

### Account  Details
Wireframe of the Account details displaying the survey results. Linking Facebook and user details. All functional requirements which were added. Please see functional requirements 23 and 3 as its based on them on a whole.
